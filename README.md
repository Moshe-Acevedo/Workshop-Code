__LED__ and __sense_hat__ represent the different "halfs" of the workshop. 

__LED__ is the first half that has to do with building a circuit and
how the Raspberry Pi can be used as a platform for building 
circuits and making them do something. 

__sense_hat__ is the second half, where students learn how to use sensors to
create functional programs. 


###LED

Here is what each file does 
+LED.py
  + This will turn the LED on and off with time input and voltage output
+Photoresistor.py
  + This will print the amount of time it takes for a capacitor to charge
+LED_Photoresistor.py
  + This will turn the LED on and off using the Photoresistor 


###sense_hat

Here is what each file does:
